Who would have thought 3 eggs and a cup of coffee can make so much a difference to a life thrown into chaos?  Not me. Fresh out of university, I had no hobby. All I do after a long day of work is browsing YouTube until I pass out to wake for another day of dull grinding. Most things in my life were left to chances and I hit the auto-pilot button right after I came out of university. What happened to hopes and dreams? Do I even have them? Isn't there more to life? The dying voice in me told me, just go find out, it's not like you have much to lose.

So I did. 

In the quest of finding hopes and dreams and self-esteem, I started with changing my breakfast.  If there's only one thing I can control, I should be able to choose what goes into my body. If I ate better, I could look and feel better without the need of coming up with excuses about how exercising isn't for me. 

I picked up an diet that is easy to stick with, because easy. Eager to upholding my principle of keeping things easy, I took just one advice from Tim Ferriss' book, the Four Hour Body - have 30g of protein first thing in the morning. Tim recommended a protein shake as the most convenient to get that much protein at one go. Me? I went with the easiest and cheapest way - 3 hard boiled eggs. Do I just want to eat eggs with nothing else? No, because I have standards. So I went with 3 very hard to swallow eggs with a cup of black instant coffee to wash them down. 

Little did I know that this small change in my behaviour ignited a momentum in me. The tiniest crack became a flood. The improvement made to my breakfast kickstarted a revolution. I then started packing healthier lunch and with tears at the corner of my squinty eyes, waved good bye to my chicken rice. Next thing I knew, I was making freaking osso buco. 

The tiniest crack became a flood. Fast forward to 10 years later. I am now much healthier and fitter to do all the things that I have grown to love without flatlining. I can now surf, climb and tango. And by the way, I cook delicious meals that are healthy.

I want to share with you what I have learned about eating better and living a fitter life without compromises. A healthier life starts by getting a little better in what you eat. That's all we need to enjoy life a little more. Make healthy and delicious food be the constant in your life, let it be the North Star that steers you to where passion leads.

I hope my stories will inspire you, or at the very least, entertain you.
